It represents the maximum value that can be returned by the `rand()` function. The `rand()` function is a weak random number generator and should not be used for generating random numbers in a security context.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, use a strong cryptographic random number generator instead of weak or non-cryptographic ones. In C++, you can use functions provided by libraries like `<random>` which provides a variety of random number generators that are more secure and less predictable than `rand()`.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of using `rand()`, use `std::random_device` and `std::mt19937` from the `<random>` library. Here is an example:\n\n```cpp\n#include <random>\n\nstd::random_device rd;  // Will be used to obtain a seed for the random number engine\nstd::mt19937 gen(rd()); // Standard mersenne_twister_engine seeded with rd()\nstd::uniform_int_distribution<> distrib(1, 6);\n\nint random_number = distrib(gen);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code example requires the `<random>` library.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)"
